## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+ and required Python library**
- **AWS CLI** (configured with valid credentials)
- **Snowflake account**
- **Download the dataset** (https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/)

## üìù Usage Guide

1. **Split Large JSON Files**
    - Run the provided Python script to split massive review files into manageable chunks:
        ```sh
        python split.py
        ```

2. **Stage & Load Data in Snowflake**
    - Use the `busi_tbl_create.sql` and `review_tbl_create.sql` scripts to create tables and load data from S3.

3. **Create Sentiment Analysis UDF**
    - Deploy the custom Python UDF from `sentiment_gen_UDF.sql` to classify review sentiments within Snowflake.

4. **Run Business & Sentiment Analysis**
    - Utilize the queries in `SQL_queries.sql` to extract business intelligence, user activity, popular categories, and rich sentiment insights.
